# Lab4 - Tidying, Cleaning, Imputation, and Outlier Detection (PROG8245)
---

This lab focuses on fundamental data preprocessing techniques including tidying, cleaning, imputing missing values, and outlier detection using Python. The datasets used include the Cars dataset (for cleaning and imputation) and the Diabetes dataset (for outlier detection).

**Objectives**

---
- Practiced tidying on pew-raw dataset and billboard dataset.
- Perform data cleaning and imputation on the Cars dataset.
- Detect and handle outliers in the Diabetes dataset using visualization and statistical methods 
  (Z-score and IQR).
- Enhance documentation with clear, concise markdown explanations.
- Ensure replicability through dependency management and environment testing.
- Utilize Git and GitHub for version control with proper commit practices.

**Project Structure**

---

- `week5Lab_Students.ipynb` : Main Jupyter Notebook with code, markdown, and visualizations.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies used in the notebook using `pip freeze > requirement.txt`command.
- `.gitignore`: Prevents sensitive and unnecessary files from being committed.
- `CSVs`: this folder contains all the csv files for all datasets-`billboard.csv`,`cars.csv`, 
          `pew-raw.csv` diabetes dataset taken from Sklearn library.


**Instructions**

---
- Clone the repo
- Create a virtual environment `python -m venv venv`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the notebook step-by-step
